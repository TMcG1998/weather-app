# Weather App

## Purpose
This app allows a user to search any location in the world to get the current weather and a 5-day forecast for that location. If a search fails, either through a user search error or an API error, the app will inform the user. Once a location is successfully searched, the page will display current temperature, humidity, wind and the UV index for the current day, and then similar information for the next 5 days. Small images will also be displayed to reflect the current weather conditions.

## Built With:
